-   The rating of the movie is represented by stars, with a maximum of 5 stars.

### Challenge 2

-   There are 5 buttons from 1 to 5 representing the rating on for each movie.
-   Clicking on a button updates the rating of that movie.
-   The button for the rating number is disabled if that rating is the current one of the movie.

### Challenge 3
